## Features
- üéÆ Interactive chess board with move highlighting
- ü§ñ AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- üé® Choice of playing as White or Black
- üìù Detailed move history with board positions
- ‚ö° Real-time game status updates
- üéØ Legal move validation and suggestions
- üèÜ Game outcome detection (checkmate, stalemate, insufficient material)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages:
  ```
  streamlit
  chess
  autogen
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd chess-game
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a requirements.txt file with the following contents:
```
streamlit
chess
autogen
```

## Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run chess_game.py
```

2. In your web browser:
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar
   - Choose your preferred color (White/Black)
   - Select AI difficulty level
   - Click "Start New Game" to begin playing

## Game Controls

- **Start New Game**: Resets the board and starts a fresh game
- **Resign Game**: Forfeit the current game
- **Move Selection**: Choose from available legal moves in UCI format (e.g., 'e2e4')
- **Move History**: Expand move entries to see board positions

## AI Difficulty Levels

- **Beginner**: Makes occasional mistakes, plays more straightforward moves
- **Intermediate**: Plays strategically, considers positional advantages
- **Advanced**: Plays aggressively, aims for tactical complications

## Technical Details

The game uses several key components:
- **Streamlit**: For the web interface and state management
- **python-chess**: For chess rules and board representation
- **AutoGen**: For AI agent behavior and decision making
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: For move analysis and generation

## Game Features

### Move Validation
- All moves are validated against chess rules
- Only legal moves are presented as options
- Invalid moves are caught and reported with clear error messages

### Board Visualization
- Current position display
- Move highlighting with arrows
- Color-coded previous move squares

### Game State Tracking
- Checkmate detection
